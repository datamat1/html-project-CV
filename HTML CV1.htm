<h2>Summary</h2>   <hr>                  		       

	In a position as a postdoctoral fellow at Khalifa University, an esteemed institution ranked 181<sup>st</sup> by QS, I am fervently
	engaged in a multitude of projects centered around the additive manufacturing of NiTi triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures. 	My active collaboration with the Advanced Digital and Additive Manufacturing Center (ADAM) at KU bolsters my endeavors. Furthermore, I 	am fortunate to collaborate with renowned universities such as the University of Thessaly in Greece and CSIR‑AMPRI in India. My 	contributions to the scientific community have been substantial, with numerous high‑impact research papers published in esteemed 	journals. Equipped with adept skills, I proficiently supervise students and successfully navigate the publication process independently. 	Moreover, I possess valuable experience in teaching mechanical engineering to undergraduate students. My research work has been 	showcased on multiple occasions at both national and international conferences, amplifying its reach and impact.
